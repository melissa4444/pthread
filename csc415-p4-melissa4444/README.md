## Build Instructions

	for my project I used Xcode to build 
	on the terminal it is also built by 
	1) making sure that you are the projects directory
	2) from there in the terminal enter make
	3) ls
	
## Run Instructions
	on Xcode all you have to do is click on the play button to run the program
	on the terminal you have to 
	1) gcc -pthread pthread_race.c
	2) ./pthread_race
## Explain why your program produces the wrong output
	my program produces the wrong Final Value of Shared Variable because I do get 0 a couple of times
